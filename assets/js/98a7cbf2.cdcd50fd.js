If you are curious, you may (as always) check the link above regarding what exactly has changed. Currently, one thing I will note in this announcement is the delay of BSA packaging our resources and completely solving performance issues. BSA packing, as you guys have seen, has been causing a lot of issues with LOD's looking funky. While I work on solving why this is happening, we will be sticking to loose files for our large scale texture packs/LOD's which will have some performance hit compared to packed BSAs. On the topic of performance, while I have made some much needed adjustments and removals which positively benefited performance (on my end), performance has always and will be an uphill battle for the foreseeable future.
