Been a bit since our last update and wanted to get out some minor fixes/additions asap to everyone :). The biggest fix was getting the desert ranger and ranger armors back to being visible, but other minor fixes have been made as well. In addition to this, the start of the game has been changed. Now, instead of leaving the vault, looting the corpses outside to get your starting gear, and moving from there, you will be given less gear. The tradeoff to this is that the gear will be more specific to your chosen tag skills and higher stats. In addition, you will now be given the option upon leaving the Vault to start your adventure in several different areas of the map. This allows the chance to start somewhere you haven\'t in the past and maybe begin a playthrough much different than you have before! If you\'re interested in a full list of additions, removals, updates, etc please check the release notes above. As always, thank you guys for continuing to play Capital Punishment, your bug reports, and I hope your holidays and breaks have been great!"},{"id":"6","metadata":{"permalink":"/KitchenSink.github.io/blog/6","source":"@site/blog/2023-12-08-06/index.md","title":"Capital Punishment 1.5.4.7 Update","description":"Save Safe?: No","date":"2023-12-08T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"December 8, 2023","tags":[{"label":"general","permalink":"/KitchenSink.github.io/blog/tags/general"},{"label":"welcome","permalink":"/KitchenSink.github.io/blog/tags/welcome"}],"readingTime":0.445,"hasTruncateMarker":false,"authors":[{"name":"TheMrNewVegas","title":"Project Lead","url":"https://www.patreon.com/Themrnewvegas","imageURL":"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/112358568/223336503-5c2b0a35-ef85-4505-a47a-1d8763a514db.png","key":"mnv"}],"frontMatter":{"slug":"6","title":"Capital Punishment 1.5.4.7 Update","authors":["mnv"],"tags":["general","welcome"]},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"Capital Punishment 1.5.5.5 Update","permalink":"/KitchenSink.github.io/blog/8"},"nextItem":{"title":"Capital Punishment 1.5.5.0 Update","permalink":"/KitchenSink.github.io/blog/7"}},"content":"**Save Safe?:** No\\n**[Release Notes](https://www.modlists.net/docs/2capitalpunishment/Release-Notes#release-1547---12082023)**\\n\\nFixed quite a few things that have been reported over the last few days, bring the list back to a more playable state than it has been post 1540.

If you are curious, you may (as always) check the link above regarding what exactly has changed. Currently, one thing I will note in this announcement is the delay of BSA packaging our resources and completely solving performance issues. BSA packing, as you guys have seen, has been causing a lot of issues with LOD\'s looking funky. While I work on solving why this is happening, we will be sticking to loose files for our large scale texture packs/LOD\'s which will have some performance hit compared to packed BSAs. On the topic of performance, while I have made some much needed adjustments and removals which positively benefited performance (on my end), performance has always and will be an uphill battle for the foreseeable future. Please read the sections I have below in regards to all of this\\n\\n## My game is running pretty slow, what can I do to increase frames?\\n\\n- Make no mistake, who doesn\'t wan\'t to run a modlist with all the bells and whistles? That being said, the high profile is not designed for every single machine out there. If you are experiencing lag, try first switching to a lower profile.\\n- If switching profiles only provides minimally positive results, try installing [NVHR](https://www.modlists.net/docs/2capitalpunishment/InstallGuide/Performance-Tweaks#downgrade-to-nvhr-32). THIS CAN BE DONE AT ANY POINT IN YOUR PLAYTHROUGH\\n- If none of these work for you or your issues still persist, then refer to [Wall\'s Performance Guide](https://performance.moddinglinked.com/falloutnv.html)\\n\\n[Reddit Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/boneyardcreations/comments/18it5yv/capital_punishment_1550_release/)"},{"id":"4","metadata":{"permalink":"/KitchenSink.github.io/blog/4","source":"@site/blog/2023-12-04-04/index.md","title":"Capital Punishment 1.5.4.5 Release","description":"Release Notes","date":"2023-12-04T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"December 4, 2023","tags":[{"label":"Capital Punishment","permalink":"/KitchenSink.github.io/blog/tags/capital-punishment"},{"label":"Update","permalink":"/KitchenSink.github.io/blog/tags/update"}],"readingTime":1.39,"hasTruncateMarker":false,"authors":[{"name":"TheMrNewVegas","title":"Project Lead","url":"https://www.patreon.com/Themrnewvegas","imageURL":"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/112358568/223336503-5c2b0a35-ef85-4505-a47a-1d8763a514db.png","key":"mnv"}],"frontMatter":{"slug":"4","title":"Capital Punishment 1.5.4.5 Release","authors":["mnv"],"tags":["Capital Punishment","Update"]},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"Capital Punishment 1.5.5.0 Update","permalink":"/KitchenSink.github.io/blog/7"},"nextItem":{"title":"Capital Punishment 1.5.4.6 Release","permalink":"/KitchenSink.github.io/blog/5"}},"content":"## **[Release Notes](https://www.modlists.net/docs/2capitalpunishment/Release-Notes#release-1545---unreleased)**\\n## **Save Safe?: NO**\\n\\nThis update fixes a few minor bugs I found throughout the last release that were brought to my attention/that I found whilst testing while also adding in the very anticipated (by the staff at least) addition - Radiant Questing!

While I know that any good list should not have it installed, it has been a long time crutch (or so we thought) for Capital Punishment considering the sheer amount we have added, let alone some mods we know that cause issues we are unable to fix. \\n\\nRecent testing with it disabled using the latest release of NVHR has posed positive results on my end, making me fairly confident that the list can and has been able to be independent of NVAC for a while. \\n\\nOf course, if you notice a large amount of crashes occur, especially those which are reproduceable, use #ttw-bug-report and let us know. It will be there optionally for those who would like the comfort of having it enabled like I have all of these months. \\n\\nFor the time being, I have disabled NVAC, but have left it under our new Optional Installations & Performance tab. If you have any performance issues going forward, please utilize our wiki that we have taken the time to write. Many users have been able to install NVHR, DXVK, and other resources mentioned here with positive results.\\n\\n## **[Optional Installs Page](https://www.modlists.net/docs/category/optional-installations)**\\n\\n### **[Reddit Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/boneyardcreations/comments/18ag3kl/capital_punishment_1545_release/)**"},{"id":"5","metadata":{"permalink":"/KitchenSink.github.io/blog/5","source":"@site/blog/2023-12-04-05/index.md","title":"Capital Punishment 1.5.4.6 Release","description":"Release Notes","date":"2023-12-04T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"December 4, 2023","tags":[{"label":"Capital Punishment","permalink":"/KitchenSink.github.io/blog/tags/capital-punishment"},{"label":"Update","permalink":"/KitchenSink.github.io/blog/tags/update"}],"readingTime":0.57,"hasTruncateMarker":false,"authors":[{"name":"TheMrNewVegas","title":"Project Lead","url":"https://www.patreon.com/Themrnewvegas","imageURL":"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/112358568/223336503-5c2b0a35-ef85-4505-a47a-1d8763a514db.png","key":"mnv"}],"frontMatter":{"slug":"5","title":"Capital Punishment 1.5.4.6 Release","authors":["mnv"],"tags":["Capital Punishment","Update"]},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"Capital Punishment 1.5.4.5 Release","permalink":"/KitchenSink.github.io/blog/4"},"nextItem":{"title":"December Update","permalink":"/KitchenSink.github.io/blog/2"}},"content":"## [Release Notes](https://www.modlists.net/docs/2capitalpunishment/Release-Notes#release-1546---12042023)\\n\\n## Save Safe?: YES (1545+)\\n\\nThis update further fixes LOD\'s and adds back NVAC, the long winded message left with 1545 was one I should have waited to send before I was sure there were no issues so my apologies.
